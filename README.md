# The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS Course: Admin Dashboard
An admin dashboard used to practice more advanced layout techniques. The information on the page is not dynamically generated, but rather static content. This project instead emphasizes on using more advanced CSS (CSS grid/Flexbox) to make a more complex page layout. The desired layout is determined by a design document which is provided in the project folder.
